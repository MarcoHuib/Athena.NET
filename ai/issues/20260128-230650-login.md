# Parity gaps (login)

## Gaps
- Auto-register user id rewrite: Athena rewrites UserId from AutoRegisterBaseId; rAthena uses _M/_F suffix logic.
- Auth failure -> refuse + dynamic IP ban on error 0/1: Both apply extra action on error 0/1; exact ban mechanism differs.

## Notes
- Auto-patching attempted where rules exist; remaining gaps need new rules or manual fixes.
